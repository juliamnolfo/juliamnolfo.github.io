            <h4> Census Outreach Graphics </h4>

            <p class="dark">In Spring 2020, I served as a Graphic Design Intern for the University of California Student Association on the Census Outreact team, a team of students who created marketing a social media content to educate UC students on the importance of the census and encourage them to fill it out. I worked closely with the Marketing team to develop graphics for outreach, completing several projects over a few short weeks. I was given complete creative freedom with each graphic, allowing me to choose the aesthetic direction for each project and experiment outside my normal style.</p>

            <h3> Instagram Post </h3>
            <p class="dark">With this Instagram post, I wanted to create something bright, colorful, and eye-catching in order to capture the interest of the viewer. I was inspired by this eye makeup I had seen on Pinterest to create utilize organic shapes, a fun type path, and bright colors.</p>

            <h3> FAQ Flyer </h3>
            <p class="dark">For this flyer, I was challenged to include a lot of copy while keeping the flyer readable and eye-catching. I chose some bright pastel colors, bulky typography, and vertical bars to keep like pieces of infromation anchored together. Here and there throughout the answers, I broke out important information with colored text to tie them back to the question and emphasis them within the paragraph. </p>

            <h3> Facebook Posts </h3>
            <p class="dark">In these Facebook posts, I decided to expirement with illustration-centric designs, which is not my usual style. I had fun with them by turning the illustrations into GIFs in order to help them stand out amongst a busy feed. </p>
