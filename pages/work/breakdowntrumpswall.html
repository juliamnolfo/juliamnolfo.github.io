                <h4> Break Down Trump's Wall </h4>
                <p><i>Break Down Trump's Wall</i> is an Android mobile game developed using MIT App Inventor, a block-based visual programming enviorment. The game was created just after the 2016 election of Donald Trump as a comedic commentary on the proposed border wall between the United States and Mexico that had become a hugely controversial theme in the President's campaign and presidency. The game is a "Brick Breaker" style game where the player moves a paddle along the bottom edge of the screen in order to bounce a ball and break each piece of brick. The player wins when they have broken down enough pieces to hit the image of Donald Trump and is rewarded with having "saved America".</p>
