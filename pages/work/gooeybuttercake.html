                <p>Toasted ravioli, provel cheese, Imo’s Pizza, Red Hot Riplets, and Ted Drewes are just a few of the amazing foods that you can only find in my hometown of St. Louis, Missouri. Since leaving STL for San Francisco, I've realized just how unfortunate the rest of the world is having not experinced these foods. So, I’ve decided to bring a little bit of The Lou with me by making the best of all St. Louis foods: Gooey Butter Cake, a sticky dense yellow cake covered in powdered sugar. (My gooey butter cake intake has been plummeting in SF and things are starting to get worrisome.) I guarantee, it’s the most heavenly thing in the world. And, if I can make it in my dorm room kitchen, you can do it too. Here’s how to make Gooey Butter Cake.</p>

                <h5> PROCESS </h5>
                <p>The original design of the website intended to use a long-scrolling format and digital illustrations for each step, but radically changed with the decision to use food photography instead in order to more beautifully show the baking process. The photography greatly drove the redesign of the site, using a more sophisticated, cookbook-style layout and color scheme. The directions in the site, contrastly, are conversational and humourous, deviating from the normal cold language of typical cooking books and sites to feel more personal and friendly. The language is in the first person, giving the voice a bit of personality, making it feel like the user is being told the recipe from a friend. </p>
