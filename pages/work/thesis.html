                <p>programmable_poetry is a collaborative poetry-writing experience between user and computer designed to cultivate a relationship of connection and understanding between human and machine. Poetry is a form of literature that expresses human emotions in very raw and intimate ways, but often requires structure and order. Based on magnetic poetry sets and emphasizing the unique skills of both human and computer, programmable_poetry begins with a program that generates random words from selected works of the user’s chosen poet. The user is then encouraged to use their own creativity to arrange the words into a poem. Once a poem is completed, it is attributed to both authors, the user and the program, and is placed into code that would digitally “print” the poem to the computer console. Lastly, the user is welcome to explore the gallery where they can place their piece among poems written by other users have. The gallery is accompanied by a series of photographs of both the human body and internal hardware, stripping both down to their most intimate parts in order to create a feeling of connection between man and machine.</p>

                <h5> PROCESS </h5>
                <p>As a digital artist, programmer, and millennial, there are few areas of my life that are not consumed by technology. Writing poetry is one of those areas. The act simply involves my notebook, a pen, and a thought: no algorithms or coding necessary. Because poetry, both the act of writing it and the actual poem, still feel so unabashedly human in a world laden with tech, I wanted to explore how poetry and technology could coexist. I’ve witnessed varying degrees of technophobia, a fear, dislike, or avoidance of new technology, in my grandparents, the computer science students I tutor, myself, and all around me. Technophobia is said to affect all people to a certain degree. With programmable_poetry, I am aiming to strengthen the user’s relationship with technology through collaboration and understanding. I think building this relationship is essential in a world that is so deeply entangled with technology.</p>
